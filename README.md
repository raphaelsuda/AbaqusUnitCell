# AbaqusUnitCell.jl
AbaqusUnitCell.jl provides functions for applying **periodic boundary conditions** on a **repeating unit cell** modelled in **Abaqus**.
The package contains functions for the following tasks:
- reading an Abaqus input-file,
- defining periodic boundary conditions,
- defining homogeneous displacement boundary conditions, and
- saving a new input-file with the defined boundary conditions.

A more detailed README will follow.
